        <p>“The time I spent learning what architecture ‘means’ has only taught me that its notion is fluid and malleable, influenced by infinite agencies. Hence, to me, the purpose of architectural design is not about finding a compromise; rather it is about using it as a medium to devise a solution without compromising. It is where science meets art, through simple transformations of predefined ideas, to generate passive, economic structures that hold and represent people to the bone.”</p>
